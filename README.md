# notebook-eph
A few small python scripts that maintain (and automatically update) a database of Argentina's Encuesta Permanente de Hogares (as produced by INDEC) using Github Actions.     
The data is available in the "data" folder, compressed in 2 separate zip files, one containing data about household (hogar) and another one containing data about individuals (individual). More information about the data can be found [here](https://www.indec.gob.ar/ftp/cuadros/menusuperior/eph/EPH_registro_2T2024.pdf) (in spanish).
